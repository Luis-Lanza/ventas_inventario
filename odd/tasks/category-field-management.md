# Category Field Management

## Objective
Allow Catalog users to add and retire category-defined product fields from **Manage Categories → Edit**, without deleting existing product attribute values.

## Problem
Category fields are created only during onboarding. The existing category editor changes its name only, so categories cannot evolve when the store needs a new product attribute or wants to stop collecting an obsolete one.

## Scope
- Add new category fields through the existing category edit path.
- Retire existing fields while preserving their definition and product attribute values.
- Exclude retired fields from current product creation/edit validation and entry forms.
- Preserve historical retired values in product detail.
- Detect a category schema change when a product draft was based on an older schema and return recoverable feedback.

## Constraints
- Do not physically delete attribute definitions or values.
- V1 does not modify the type, required flag, label, or option set of an existing field.
- Keep stable definition IDs for retained fields.
- A retired field label may be reused by a new active definition; SQLite uniqueness applies to active definitions only.
- Category schema mutation must be transactional, revision-checked, and audited.
- Existing unrelated untracked ODD task files remain untouched.
- TDD mode: standard; source: `openspec/config.yaml` (`sdd.strict_tdd: false`).
- Rust runner: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
- Delivery strategy: ask-on-risk. Forecast: ~350 authored changed lines, excluding generated files.

## Tasks
- [x] T1 Define category-schema lifecycle contracts and canonical acceptance scenarios. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: focused domain/application tests specify add, retire, retained values, invalid stable-ID edits, revision conflicts, and stale product schemas.
- [x] T2 Persist active/retired definitions and implement transactional category-schema diff. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: migrations, SQLite/application/domain tests, audit/revision behavior, and rollback evidence.
- [x] T3 Expose schema editing through typed Tauri/TypeScript contracts and enforce stale product-schema handling. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: Rust command registration/contracts, TypeScript runtime decoders, malformed payloads, and product mutation conflict tests.
- [x] T4 Add accessible Manage Categories editor controls for adding and retiring fields. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: flow and mounted tests for drafts, confirmation, pending/error/stale states, keyboard accessibility, and existing product form/detail behavior.
- [x] T5 Run focused end-to-end seam validation and independent verification. Route: delegated direct; trigger: verification. Checks: full Rust suite, full frontend suite, test typecheck, and diff check all pass.
- [x] T6 Refine category editor visuals from Windows review. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: mounted editor scroll/save behavior and focused mounted suite.
- [x] T7 Fix Windows visual defects in the category editor: prevent sticky identity overlap, compact/align required checkbox, and add accessible per-draft discard. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: mounted interactions preserve remaining drafts, category save action, and retirement confirmation.
- [x] T8 Correct Windows draft-field layout from screenshot: full-width name row followed by a compact type/required/discard row with responsive wrapping and no overlap. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: mounted coverage asserts the structure, visible `× Descartar` action, native checkbox sizing, and preservation of draft-discard behavior.
- [x] T9 Refine the category editor modal and field draft from the authorized Windows screenshot: widen modestly at desktop and combine draft name/type/required controls into a dense responsive row with conditional full-width options. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: mounted coverage verifies layout hooks, conditional options, native compact checkbox, accessible inline discard, and existing discard behavior.
- [x] T10 Apply radical density refinement from the authorized Windows screenshot: widen the desktop editor to about 680px, render each new field as one compact wrapping row without a card/title or text discard action, and compact existing/history rows to about 48px while retaining standard Add field sizing. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: mounted coverage verifies one-row draft controls, accessible icon discard, native required checkbox, responsive wrapping hooks, compact existing/history rows, modal width, and preserved discard behavior.
- [x] T11 Keep new-field controls on one deterministic row at the 680px desktop dialog width: flexible name, fixed 9rem type, compact native checkbox with an unbroken Obligatorio label, and accessible discard icon; allow wrapping only in the narrow-viewport fallback. Route: delegated direct; trigger: multi-file write. Checks: mounted coverage verifies desktop no-wrap sizing, accessible discard, and deliberate narrow-screen wrapping.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A category can gain a valid field through its edit dialog.
- A field can be retired with explicit confirmation; its existing values remain stored and historically visible.
- Retired fields are not requested or required for new/current product edits.
- A product save based on a stale category schema fails safely and prompts reload rather than silently losing or misvalidating values.
- Invalid/duplicate field definitions, stale category revisions, and persistence failure preserve existing data.

## Progress
- 2026-09-27: Authorized by user. Read-only exploration completed. User selected retirement with value preservation. Branch: `feat/category-field-management`.
- 2026-09-27: T1/T2 backend slice recovered after an interrupted worker. The partial diff was reconciled; no unrelated tracked files were changed.
- 2026-09-27: Independent verification previously failed T1/T2: replacement labels, v19 structural validation, and candidate Rust formatting required correction.
- 2026-09-27: Focused correction checks passed, but independent reassessment failed: the existing `UNIQUE(category_id, label)` constraint prevents reusing a retired field label, despite the domain planner allowing it. Candidate-added formatting findings also remained outside the last correction surface.
- 2026-09-27: T1/T2 corrected: schema v19 rebuilds the definitions table to replace label uniqueness with a partial active-only unique index; migration tests retain IDs, options, values, and FK integrity, and the SQLite use case retires then recreates the same label with a new ID. Focused T1/T2 suites pass; candidate Rust additions are formatted. Full cargo fmt remains blocked by unrelated baseline formatting debt.
- 2026-09-27: Closed the remaining v19 validation gap by rejecting any non-partial unique index on `(category_id, label)`, independent of index name, while preserving validation of the required active-only partial index. Added a differently named global-index regression case; focused Rust suites and diff check pass.
- 2026-09-27: Tightened v19 validation to require the active-label partial index predicate to normalize exactly to `active=1`; added a regression for `active=1 OR active=0`. Focused SQLite catalog tests pass; repository-wide formatting remains blocked by the documented unrelated baseline debt.

## Evidence
- 2026-09-27: T3 IPC/application implementation is currently partial: focused Rust maintenance suites passed (31 tests), TypeScript catalog tests passed (17 tests), and `git diff --check` passed. Product schema revision is now carried in the Rust/TypeScript edit contract and stale saves return `stale_category_schema`; however, the existing product edit-flow producer under `src/ui/catalog/catalog-maintenance-flow.ts` is outside the delegated edit surfaces and does not yet supply that revision. Do not treat T3 as complete until the caller contract is resolved.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --test catalog_maintenance_domain --test catalog_maintenance_application --test catalog_maintenance_sqlite --test product_onboarding`: passed (40 tests), including retired-label recreation, v18→v19 migration preservation/structural validation, and rejection of a differently named global unique index.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check`: fails on existing formatting debt in unrelated baseline tests (`confirm_sale_use_case.rs`, `dashboard_reporting.rs`, `inventory_domain.rs`, `inventory_sqlite.rs`, `product_onboarding.rs`, `sales_history_commands.rs`, `sqlite_migrations.rs`). The formatter output contains no findings in `src-tauri/src/infrastructure/sqlite/mod.rs` or `src-tauri/tests/catalog_maintenance_sqlite.rs`; those candidate files are formatted. Baseline and candidate both retain the unrelated formatter debt.
- Independent verification: previous T1/T2 defects are covered by the passing schema replacement, lifecycle, migration structural-validation, rollback, and arbitrary-name global-index tests; ready for reassessment.
- Final v19 predicate-gap correction: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --test catalog_maintenance_sqlite` passed (20 tests), including rejection of `WHERE active = 1 OR active = 0`; `git diff --check` passed. `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check` fails only on unrelated pre-existing formatting findings in tests outside the authorized edit surfaces; neither modified Rust file appears in formatter output. This matches the baseline formatting failures recorded above.

- T3 wiring completion: exposed `category_revision` in product metadata detail, decoded and validated it in TypeScript, sent it as `expected_category_revision` from product edits, and made `stale_category_schema` trigger recoverable edit handling while preserving stale product behavior. Verified by `npx tsx --test src/commands/catalog.test.ts src/ui/catalog/catalog-maintenance-flow.test.ts` (23 passed), `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --test catalog_maintenance_application --test catalog_maintenance_commands --test catalog_maintenance_sqlite` (31 passed), and `git diff --check` (passed).

- 2026-09-27: T4 adds accessible category schema drafts, keeps existing definitions immutable, requires confirmation before retirement, omits retired definitions from the typed schema-edit request, and reloads authoritative detail after stale schema conflicts. The exact focused frontend test command passed (53 tests), and `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-09-27: Fixed two independently verified T4 regressions: retired required product attributes are omitted from edit form state, field validation, and edit requests while backend detail continues to retain historical definitions/values; a stale category-schema product edit now reloads selected authoritative detail through the established stale-record recovery flow. Added unit and mounted regression coverage, including existing stale-product recovery behavior.
- T5 final stale current-schema assertion now compares against `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`; `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` passed, `npm test` passed (307 tests), `npm run typecheck:tests` passed, and `git diff --check` passed.
- T6 Windows visual refinement: active category definitions now render as compact immutable rows, retired definitions remain compact history, drafts use compact grouped controls, and the dialog footer owns the single primary save action. Category name edits remain supported through that action, including when schema changes are submitted first; the dialog content is its sole internal scroll region. Retirement confirmation and dialog semantics remain unchanged. The focused mounted suite passed (33 tests); `git diff --check` passed.
- T7 Windows visual correction: removed sticky positioning from the category identity banner so it cannot cover the category-name label/content; required checkbox and label now form a compact inline row; every unsaved draft has an accessible Discard action that removes only that draft. Mounted coverage verifies individual discard while retaining another draft and its entered value; existing mounted assertions continue to cover one primary save and confirmed retirement. Exact mounted runner passed (34 tests); `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-09-27: T8 Windows screenshot correction: draft field name now occupies its own full-width row; type select, native 18px required checkbox with label, and inline `× Descartar` action share a wrapping responsive row. Mounted test checks the layout hooks and visible action while retaining discard behavior. Exact mounted runner passed (34 tests); `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-09-27: T9 Windows screenshot refinement: desktop category editor modal is 600px maximum while retaining the 520px narrow-screen fallback. Draft heading now pairs its title with `× Descartar`; name, type, and a native 1rem required checkbox share one wrapping compact row, with options shown only for option type and spanning the draft width. Mounted coverage verifies responsive CSS hooks, option visibility toggling, checkbox sizing, and preserving another draft after discard. Exact mounted runner passed (34 tests); `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-09-27: T10 Windows screenshot refinement: desktop category editor modal now caps at 680px; draft fields are a single compact wrapping row with no card/title and a glyph-only accessible discard button, while native labeled controls and option-type conditional input remain intact. Existing active and retired history rows have a 48px minimum height; Add field retains its standard secondary Action sizing. Mounted coverage checks the new row shape, icon accessible name, checkbox, responsive flex wrapping, modal width, and compact history rows. Exact mounted runner passed (34 tests); `git diff --check` passed.
- 2026-09-27: T11 makes the draft controls a non-wrapping desktop row with a flexible name, fixed 9rem type selector, compact native required checkbox and nowrap label, and accessible discard icon; only viewports at or below 699px use the explicit wrap fallback. Mounted coverage asserts the desktop sizing/no-wrap contract and narrow fallback. Exact mounted runner passed (34 tests); `git diff --check` passed.

## Next Step
- T1–T11 are complete; focused mounted category validation and diff check passed.
